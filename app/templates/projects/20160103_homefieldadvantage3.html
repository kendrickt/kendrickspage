<h1 class="blog-post-title">Home Field Advantage (pt 3)</h1>
<p class="blog-post-meta">January 3rd, 2016</p>

<p>I took a short hiatus to transfer my blog posts from Google's blog application to this website.
I had to learn a few new technologies, but now that that's been sorted out I'm back in business!
Before I move away from home field advantages, I transfered my local system into a little web application!
