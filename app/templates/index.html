            <h1>Building a Better Tree</h1>
            <p>Last time, I tried predicting whether a passenger of the Titanic survived using only their sex and passenger class.
            This time around, I look at how to evaluate the performance of a tree, and address my under-fitting and over-fitting problems.</p>

                <h2>Trees, Breakfast, and the RMS Titanic</h2>
                <p>This is the first of a series of blog posts which is document my experience
                as I learn about decision trees! In this post, I share how I use a decision tree
                to help me pick my breakfast, and how I use a simple decision tree to predict the
                surival of passengers on the Titanic.</p>

                <h2>Angry Doug and the Seattle Receiver Corp</h2>
                <p>Angry Doug has put up quite phenominal numbers in his past few games. How does he actually compare to the top receivers of 2015?
                How does he compare to himself since 2012? And how does he compare to Carolina's receivers?
                Long story short: things are looking pretty good for Angry Doug and Seattle.</p>

                <h2>Home Field Advantage (pt 3)</h2>
                <p>If you read my last post (home field advantage pt 2), I included some plots which compared
                teams based on their win-rating, points per game, and points allowed per game.
                Now you can generate your own plots!
