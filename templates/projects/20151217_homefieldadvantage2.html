<h1 class="blog-post-title">Home Field Advantage (pt 2)</h1>
<p class="blog-post-meta">December 17th, 2015</p>


<p>Last week, I introduced some ideas about home field advantage across the NFL. To briefly summarize: more games are won at home, more points are scored at home, and less points allowed at home. Just to provide some numbers (with some rounding): every year, each team is expected to have one more game at home than away; every game, the home team is expected to have a field goal worth of points more than the away team (this is a generous rounding). In other words, across the NFL, the home field advantage is a marginal effect.</p>

<p>Here in Seattle, we like to boast about the 12s and we have the highest number of false starts to back it up. But what is the actual result of playing at home? And how do we compare against other teams in the NFL?</p>

<p>Like last week, I'll be using the points per game (PPG), points allowed per game (PAPG), the spread per game (SPG), and win rating. So let's get started.</p>

<h2>At-Home Win-Rating</h2>
<p>Who has the best at-home win rating (2009 - 2015 week 14)? I'll get right to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>New England (0.909)</li>
<li>Green Bay (0.818)</li>
<li>Baltimore (0.759)</li>
<li>Seattle (0.722)</li>
<li>Pittsburgh (0.709)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not surprising since NE and GB win a bunch of games overall - both at home and away. To isolate the home field advantage, I looked at the at-home to away in rating ratio. In general, this is greater than 1.0. In fact, since 2009, all but three teams have won more home games than away. For those who are curious, those three teams are Philadelphia, Dallas, and Tampa Bay. So, who has the best at-home win rating ratio?</p>
<ol>
<li>Jacksonville (2.053)</li>
<li>Minnesota (2.037)</li>
<li>Cleveland (1.964)</li>
<li>Baltimore (1.74)</li>
<li>St. Louis (1.662)</li>
<li>Seattle (1.655) - I had to put this one in.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where did NE and GB go? Like I said earlier, they win games no matter where they play. In the win rating ratio list, NE and GB come in at 11th and 12th place with 1.444 and 1.425, respectively.</p>

<p>Where did Jacksonville, Minnesota, and Cleveland come from? The team with the best win rating ratio is Jacksonville, with a staggering 0.418 at-home win rating. That is bad, but not the worst! They have the 26th best at-home win rating. Unfortunately for them, that means they have a pitiful away win rating. It is a similar situation for Cleveland (0.4 win rating, 29th place). Minnesota, on the other hand, comes in closer to the middle of the list (0.630, 13th place).</p>

<p>Do I actually care about Jacksonville, Minnesota, Cleveland, New England, or Green Bay? Not really. I'm more interested in teams who consistently perform well at home, and not just because they always perform well. I'm going to call these Type A teams. There won't be other types, but it'll help me talk about teams with Type A characteristics. Teams like Jacksonville, Minnesota, and Cleveland play a lot better at home than they do away, but that doesn't actually mean they play well at home. New England and Green Bay on the other hand play well no matter where they are. So which teams are Type A? I made a chart to help me identify them:</p>
  
<!-- IMAGE GOES HERE -->

<p>Allow me to break this chart up into four groups. Teams towards the bottom left corner don't win at home, but don't do much worse away (except for PHI, DAL, and TB, who do better away). Teams towards the bottom right corner don't win at home, and really don't do well away, either. Teams in the top left play well at home and don't do much worse away, but there aren't too many teams here, if any. The last group is the Type A group - teams towards the top right play well at home, and not as well when they play away.</p>

<p>If I were feeling hand-wavey, I would assign New England, Green Bay, SF, Arizona, Seattle, Baltimore, and Minnesota as Type A teams. Instead, I'll do something quantitative.</p>

<p class="indented-p">Quick tangent: I did cross country in high school (sort of...). To quantify how well each school performed, they would take the first five runners of each school, and add up when they crossed the finish line. The team with the lowest score won. I'll do something similar for this analysis.</p>

<p>I added up how each team places with respect to their at-home win rating to how each team places with respect to their win rating ratio. With no surprise, the top seven teams are Baltimore (7), Seattle (10), New England (12), Green Bay (14), Minnesota (15), San Francisco (17), and Arizona (18).</p>

<p>So which teams are Type A? Well seeing as I made up the term and definition, I'm only going to arbitrarily say any team less than 11 points is Type A. Looks like Seattle makes the cut (whew!). Again, I'm just joking. It's up to the reader to decide for themselves who they want to put in the Type A group.</p>

<p>Now that we have an idea of who has a significant home field advantage, let's go a little deeper and look at how their offensive and defensive performances are effected. To do this, I used each team's PPG and PAPG.</p>
